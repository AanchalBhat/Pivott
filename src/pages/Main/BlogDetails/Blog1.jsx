        <h4>What is marketing automation?</h4>
        <p>
          Marketing automation is a technology that enables businesses
          to centrally plan out and control all of their client
          interactions, handling marketing campaigns and procedures
          automatically across many platforms. It uses software to
          streamline repetitive marketing tasks that consume the most
          time if done otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Automation saves time and money and improves a brand's
          ability to put the correct information in front of customers
          at the right time, all of which contribute to higher
          marketing ROI. Sending emails, updating social media, A/B
          testing, lead scoring, and ad retargeting are a few of the
          processes that can be automated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, marketing automation streamlines daily duties
          and frees up team members to focus on giving clients
          individualized experiences across several platforms. It
          helps in data collection and building client profiles for
          audience segmentation.
